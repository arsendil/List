# List<T> - Custom Doubly Linked List in C++

This is a fully-featured templated doubly linked list implementation in C++.  
It provides most of the functionality of `std::list` from the C++ Standard Library.

## Features

- **Dynamic size management**: push/pop front/back, insert, erase, resize.
- **Iterators**: supports forward, reverse, const, and non-const iterators.
- **Splice operations**: move elements or ranges from one list to another.
- **Element operations**: remove, remove_if, unique, merge, sort, reverse.
- **Comparison operators**: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`.
- **Swap operation**: exchange contents with another list.
- **Exception-safe**: basic exception safety guaranteed.
